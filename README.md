# Neural_Network_Models
# 🧠 Neural Network Models in Keras  Welcome to my collection of neural network projects using TensorFlow/Keras. Each project is built from scratch using public datasets and includes training code, saved models, and evaluation metrics.

## 📌 Projects

### 1. 🔬 Breast Cancer Detection using Neural Network
- **Dataset**: [Scikit-learn Breast Cancer Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html)
- **Model**: Binary classification using a Dense Neural Network
- **Accuracy Achieved**: ~96–98%
- **Kaggle Notebook**: (https://www.kaggle.com/code/psaidurga/breast-cancer-detection-using-nn)

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

To run any model locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Saidurga13/neural_network_models
cd neural_network_models/breast-cancer-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt

🗃️ Contents
📓 Jupyter Notebook with full model

🧠 Saved .h5 Keras model file

📊 Accuracy & Loss visualization

📁 Expandable for more datasets (Iris, MNIST, etc.)

✨ Coming Soon
